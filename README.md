# Image extractor

To create a localized version of the game "Two Rooms and a Boom", I needed a small tool that extracts the card graphics
from the images.

## Get started

* Download the Print & Play version of the game: https://www.pnpparadise.com/set-4/two-rooms-and-a-boom
* Open the PDFs and save them as PNG images (works with Adobe Acrobat).
* Configure the input and output directory (see `application.properties`).

## Limitations

It is not 100% perfect, because some maps have one pixel line or row too many. But that's enough for me, because I can
quickly rework them manually.
